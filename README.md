## An example of sensitivity analysis using Bioprocess Library for Modelica 

Here I will make a short description of these simulations....

Files:
 - b13.mo - The Modelica model with two configuration with/without noise
 - b13_batch.py - Python script that runs the model without noise, result br13_batch.png
 - b13_batch_sweep - Script that that runs the model with 20x20 parameter settings, results br13_batch_sweep_fig1_400.png and br13_batch_sweep_fig2_400.png
 - b13_batch_noise,oy - Script that run the model with noise, result br13_batch_noise_seed_1.png and _seed_2.png
 - b13_batch_noise_sweep - Script that runs the model with 20x20 parameter settings, results br13_batch_noise_sweep_fig1_400.png and _fig2_400.png

The software used here is JModelica from Modelon in Lund. It is free and open source and you can obtain it here:
